# Bart's Backbone Scaffold
I set up this scaffold so I can hit the ground running when starting with a new Backbone app.
It'll likely change over time, but I think this is about as big as it is gonna get, I like to keep it nice and small.

I replaced Underscore with Lodash, and I'm using jQuery slim instead of the full build. Besides that all is just good ol' Backbone.js and Require.js.

# Todo
  Improve performance, consider Gulp or Grunt and combining scripts/styles.
  Consider removing Skeleton.
